This REST based application will pull product details from Sainsbury's website and display the details in json.

To scrape the details run this SpringBoot app and trigger the following url

<pre>
URL: localhost:8080/product/all
Method: GET
</pre>

This application contains tests as TDD was followed. However due to limited time, very few tests are written.
